[O]h [M]an, [I] [H]ave [A]lready [S]een [I]t!

Have you ever watched an episode of your favorite tv show just to recognize 
after a few minutes that you have already seen it? 

Check out omihasi and you will never have to say again: Oh man, 
I have already seen it!


## Installation & Usage

Just fork the repository and use it in on your localhost. I created a vhost 
for the site, but you can do whatever you want as long as the console does 
not display any errors :-) Anyway, you have to create a css file from the 
SCSS (by running ```grunt```) and install the bower components (```bower 
install```.
 
Alternatively, you can use the "app" from the Github page you can find here 
http://raven1.github.io/omihasi/

You don't need any database, it uses the local storage of your browser (so 
the data you save in one browser will not be available in another browser).


## Used Technologies, Frameworks and Libraries

- HTML5 Boilerplate (http://html5boilerplate.com/) as base 
- Bower (http://bower.io/) as dependency manager
- Grunt as Task Runner (http://gruntjs.com/)
- Zurb Foundation and SASS (http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html) as CSS
 framework
- Ember.js (http://emberjs.com) as application framework


## Development & Contribution

The code is licensed using the MIT license, so feel free to do whatever you 
want with the code. You can send PRs, report bugs or just make suggestions in
 the issues.
 
 If you want to develop: Just run ```grunt``` which will trigger a watcher to
  generate the CSS file out of it. Everything else should be straightforward.
